# Sentiment analysis on Reviews given by viewers on IMDB
The Dataset and The Problem to Solve

In this Project, we’ll use an IMDB dataset of 50k movie reviews available on Kaggle. The dataset contains 2 columns (review and sentiment) that will help us identify whether a review is positive or negative.


# Problem formulation
Our goal is to find which machine learning model is best suited to predict sentiment (output) given a movie review (input).
This project involves in some steps they are:
1) Importing necessary libraries.
2) Preparing the data.
3) Dealing with Imbalanced Classes.
In most cases, you’ll have a large amount of data for one class, and much fewer observations for other classes. This is known as imbalanced data because the number of observations per class is not equally distributed.
4) Splitting data into train and test set.
5) Text Representation (Bag of words).
6) Model Selection.
7) Model Evaluation.
8) Tuning the Model.
